	11g
		express edition		free

1 computer where we installed server part
	database files are stored in server

in 20 other computers, we installed the client

Task1:
https://login.oracle.com/

Start coding -> that will ask you to sign in (you can signup)

sample schemas (databases)
HR schema (for example)
	EMPLOYEES
	DEPARTMENTS

Relation	(example: table)
Relationship
Tuple	record/row
Column	
NULL	empty, not a space, not a zero, not a hyphen, (null)
	it means the data is missing
CONSTRAINTS
	PRIMARY
	FOREIGN
	SECONDARY
	SUPERY
	CANDIDATE
	ALTERNATE KEY
	COMPOSITE KEY
	UNIQUE
	NOT NULL
	CHECK
	DEFAULT

PRIMARY KEY
	there are severals rows (records) in a table. 
	To identify a row uniquely from a table, 
	i) Cannot accept duplicate values
	ii) Cannot be NULL		we have to give a value for sure.

	we ensure ENTITY Integrity




CONSTRINTS
	CONDITIONS THAT RESTRICT



DATA INTEGRITY
	i) Entity Integrity
		ensures that every entity is identified unqiuely
		PRIMARY KEY
	ii) Domain Integrity
		ensures that the data entered in a column follows the domain rules
		PINCODE
			6 digits
		ZIPCODE
			5 digits
		implement it using
			CHECK constraint
	iii) Referential Integrity
		Foreign key
			can we store duplicate values in foreign key column		(Yes)
			can we store null value in foreign key column			(Yes)
	iv) User defined data integrity
		we implement it using triggers


CUSTOMER
	Patient	hospital
	Passenger	transportant
	

Normalization
-----------------
	reducing the redundancy

1NF 
	A table will be in first normal form only if every column or cell has precisely only 1 data.
2NF
	A table will be already in 1NF and then every column is funtionally dependent on whole key, not part of key
3NF
	A table will be already in 2NF and then every column is funtionally dependent on primary key, not part of key
