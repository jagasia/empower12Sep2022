Types of testing
---------------------
manual / automated 

unit testing
integration testing
regression testing


What is Junit?

.jar 



@Override

annotation = comment


comment
	//
	/*		*/

comments are ignored by the compiler.

@Deprecated

@Test


--------------------
Task:

Create an AUT that class contains few methods.

You need to test these methods using a Test class

test the aut 



-------------
4) Run test:

	Result result = JUnitCore.runClasses(TestJunit.class);
		
      for (Failure failure : result.getFailures()) {
         System.out.println(failure.toString());
      }
		
      System.out.println(result.wasSuccessful());



@BeforeEach		(junit 5)
@BeforeClass		(junit 4)

What is the difference between @Before and @BeforeClass

before 
	is executed before every test method
beforeClass
	is executed only once for the entire test class



Test Suite
	is a collection of test cases

--------------------------------------------

Task:

Create 3 test classes
and create a test suite
and run
	test 1 and test 3 classes

and run
	test 2 and test 3 classes


package test;

import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.junit.runners.Suite;
import org.junit.runners.Suite.SuiteClasses;

@RunWith(Suite.class)
@SuiteClasses({MathematicsTest2.class,MathematicsTest3.class})
public class MySuite {

}


-----------------
Activity:
Identify how Category runner can be used in junit
so that some of the test methods are given an category and we run a particular category only.


TasK:

Identify Paramterized test runner.
	we can supply test cases as a collection	(array list)
