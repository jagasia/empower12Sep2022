Yesterday we learnt:
Basics, 
Normalization, 
SQL(DDL, DML, TCL)
----------------------------------
Today we continue from DCL

DCL
	Data Control Language

we can 
	Grant
	Revoke

		privileges 

What are privileges?
	Permissions.
		Every user must be grant privileges in order to everything

	There are several privileges defined in ORACLE
	Only those users who have those privileges can do those operations.


Activity:
	Identify as many privileges in ORACLE

There are 2 types of privileges:
	SYSTEM Privileges
		allow us to create objects, 
			login	
		DDL related privileges are system privileges
		CREATE SESSION

			
	OBJECT Privileges
		specific to object
			i call allow an user to SELECT, INSERT on a particular object. 
		DML related privileges are object priveleges

	CREATE TABLE
	ALTER TABLE
	CREATE VIEW
	SELECT ON

Privilege              Description
SELECT               Privilege to perform SELECT statements on the table.
INSERT                Privilege to perform INSERT statements on the table.
UPDATE               Privilege to perform UPDATE statements on the table.
DELETE                Privilege to perform DELETE statements on the table.
REFERENCES      Privilege to create a constraint that refers to the table.
ALTER                  Privilege to perform ALTER TABLE statements to change
                              the table definition.
INDEX                  Privilege to create an index on the table with the create index
                              statement.
ALL                       All privileges on table.






When we install oracle in our system,
	there will be few users already present
	sys
	system
	scott
	hr		(locked)		we have to i) unlock	ii) change password

who can create new users?
	sys, system they can do everything.
	any user can be GRANT with CREATE USER privilege



Task:
	understand the difference between
		WITH GRANT OPTION
		WITH ADMIN OPTION
