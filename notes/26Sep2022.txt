Stream api
	Activity:
		What is java stream api?

1) use to process the collection of objects
2) sequence of elements supporting sequence, aggregate operations
3) a stream is not a datastructure, it takes input from collection		
		Arrays.stream(arr);
4) stream itself do not have data. It works on collection / array
5) A stream operation returns stream



	Map<String, Double> result = empList.stream()
	.collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment,Collectors.averagingDouble(Employee::getSalary)));



Task:
	stream api to find	
	1)	department wise sum of salary
	2)		avg salary

	3) 	find the largest salary of all employees
			min, max
		map	employee to name alone
	4) 	filter employees based on various attributes		like department
	5) 	sort employees by id, name etc

Java
	Operators
		shift operators		<<		>>
		<< shifts the 1s to left

		1		in binary is =	1 in decimal
		10				2 in decimal

		10	=	2 in decimal. But after 1 right shift???
		1	=	1 in decimal

	left shift operators are like multiply by 2
	right shift operators are like divide by 2

	>>2		2 positions it will shift to right		100	=	1	divide by 4

	>>2	is same as /2 power 2


	+=	-=	/=	*=	%=

	ternary operator		?:

	(x>5)?true:false


----------------------------------------
Data types:
	how many data types are there in Java language?
		int
		long
		short
		byte

		float
		double

		char

		boolean

Wrapper classes provide reference type for the primitives


in c++
	void swap(int i, int j)		//call by value
	{
	}


	void swap(int *i, int *j)	//call by reference
	{
	}


	swap(a,b);		//a and b are actual parameters passed by value
	swap(&a,&b);	//a and b are actual parameters passed by reference

	swap(int i, int j)		in java
	swap(Integer i, Integer j)	in java


Integer x=20;
int y=x;



class JInteger
{
	int value;
}


---------------------------
methods
	camelCase
	doThis()

	verbNoun()



getters & setters
accesors & mutators


constructors
	

System.gc();


String
------------
	methods
	

char c='A';
c++;
System.out.println(c);

B


ascii value of 0	is 	48


Password strength
	length check		8 or above is ok
	atleast 1 upper case character	
	atleast 1 lower case character
	at least 1 number
	at least 1 symbol


5 checks are there. 

5 = good
3 = average
<3 = weak


How do you know that a character is a number or not?

char x='0';

if(x>='0')
if(x>=48)
------------------
char x='0';
if(x=='0')		//true

if(x==48)		//true

char x='0';

if(Character.isDigit(x))		//true


if(Character.isLetter(x))		//returns true if x has an alphabet		

-----------------------
String reverse
	StringBuilder 
		reverse()

Arrays
-----------


What will be the result of compiling the following program?
public class MyClass {
long var;
public void MyClass(long param) { var = param; } // (Line no 1)
public static void main(String[] args) {
MyClass a, b;
a = new MyClass(); // (Line no 2) 
}
}



A compilation error will occur at (Line no 1), since constructors cannot specify a return value	
A compilation error will occur at (2), since the class does not have a default constructor	
A compilation error will occur at (Line no 2), since the class does not have a constructor that takes one argument of type int.	The program will compile without errors.
