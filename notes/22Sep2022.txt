Process
	is a running instance of a Program


	
Single Threaded process
Multi Threaded process

Process can contain one or more threads
Main thread
	

Thread
	is a sequence / flow of execution


display1();		
display2();			//synchronous

using threads, we can do asynchronous programming

Parallel
Concurrent

Processor
	allocating resources to each process

resource 
	time
	memory
advantages:
1) effective utilization of resources
2) parallelism or concurrency
3) asynchronous programming

drawbacks:
1) race condition
2) dead lock
3) lock starvation


When will a thread die?
	1) work is over
	2) when process is dead,	all the threads inside the process are also dead
	3) when you assign null

--------------------------
How can we create Thread?

Thread t1=new Thread();

run()		define the work of the thread

	public void displayEven()
	{
	}

	public void run()
	{
		displayEven();
	}


class MyThread extends Thread
{
	public void run()
	{
	}
}

MyThread mt=new MyThread();
mt.start();				//start will call the run method

2 ways we can create Thread.
1) extends Thread
2) implements Runnable		(functional interface)	it has only run() method


Demo1:	using (extends Thread)

t1	displays 	Odd numbers from 1 to 19
t2 	displays	Even numbers from 2 to 20


TasK:
--------
Create 2 subclasses of Thread and override the run method
first thread to display odd numbers
second thread to display even numbers

extends Thread
------------------------

TasK:	(hangman game)

The program should display a question (GK). 
The user should answer the question within 25 seconds. If not, the program should display "Failed" message and terminate.
If user answers before 25 seconds, then "Congratulations" message should be displayed.

------------------------------------------------------

extends Thread
implements Runnable


class MThread implements Runnable
{
	public void run()
	{
	}
}

Thread t1=new Thread(new MThread());
Thread t2=new Thread(()->{
	//code here
});



Create a thread using Runnable interface
